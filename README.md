#OPFoundationKit - new Foundational objects

OPFoundationKit contains some of the custom Foundation subclasses we've needed while building apps.

##Highlights

`OPOrderedMutableDictionary` : Pretty much a straight rip from Matt Gallagher's [OrderedDictionary](http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/12/ordereddictionary-subclassing-cocoa.html), but with a slightly changed interface and made compatible with ARC.

##Installation

We love [CocoaPods](http://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods), so we recommend you use it.

##Demo

Checkout [OPKitDemo](http://www.opetopic.com) for a demo application using OPExtensionKit, among other things.
